## About Me

Hello! I'm Lucas Martins, and I'm currently focused on honing my skills in Front-End development. I'm passionate about creating interactive and user-friendly web applications, and I'm excited to share my journey with you.

## Current Focus

Right now, my main areas of study and expertise revolve around the following technologies:

- **React.js**: I'm diving deep into React to build dynamic and efficient user interfaces. React is at the forefront of modern web development, and I find its component-based approach highly effective.

- **Next.js**: I'm exploring Next.js to build server-rendered React applications. It's a powerful framework that helps me create fast-loading and SEO-friendly web apps.

- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is my choice for writing statically typed JavaScript. It enhances code quality and helps me catch errors early in the development process.

- **Chakra UI**: I'm also experimenting with Chakra UI, a component library for building accessible and responsive user interfaces. It streamlines the UI development process and helps maintain a consistent design system.

## My Projects

You can check out some of my Front-End projects in my repositories. I'm actively working on various projects that showcase my skills and knowledge in these technologies.
